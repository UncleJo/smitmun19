                        <br>
                        <p>A Model United Nations delegate is a participant
                        who represents the position of a country other than
                        his country of origin, and deliberates on issues from the country's perspective, and NOT the delegate's perspective or point of view. The delegates will play the positions of national representatives such as Ambassadors, Ministers, and other diplomats or representatives of intergovernmental Organizations (IGOs) and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). It will be wrong for a MUN Delegate to argue from his/her perspective which contradicts that of the country he/she is representing.</p>

                                <li>Don't write a resolution that just states the problem, work towards a solution to the problem first.</li>
                                <li>Whenever possible, don't condemn If you are trying to solve a problem, condemning one party rarely helps</li>
                                <li>Compromise, compromise, compromise What does your nation really need to see in a solution, and what are you willing to compromise?</li>
                                <li>Credit others whenever possible Nothing makes friends faster than proving that you were listening, and giving credit to others for their ideas.</li>

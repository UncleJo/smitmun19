                            <p>Model United Nations is a simulation of the UN General Assembly and other multilateral bodies. In an MUN students typically roleplay delegates to the United Nations. While playing their roles as ambassadors, student "delegates" make speeches, prepare draft resolutions, negotiate with allies and adversaries, resolve conflicts, and navigate the Model UN conference rules of procedure - all in the interest of mobilizing international cooperation to resolve problems that affect countries all over the world. The delegates' in-depth knowledge of their countries guarantees a lively and memorable experience. </p>

                        <div class="cd-faq-content">
                            <p>Participation in Model United Nations broadens the students horizon and enriches their knowledge regarding the world around them. People with widely varying sets of thoughts and viewpoints come together in an MUN, discuss their ideas, negotiate diplomatically and ultimately arrive at a viable resolution. Being a part of an MUN's intellectual crowd teaches one a lot- from a nation's history to its intended future. Because of the diversified participation it receives, MUN conferences offer an exposure to oratory and behavioural skills like none other. Moreover, meeting interesting people and making new friends is something that makes the MUN experience all the more enjoyable. </p>

                        <div class="cd-faq-content">
                            <p>A Model United Nations delegate represents the country/organisation they have been allotted and debates on the given agenda(s) from the perspective of the delegation. Every delegate is expected to follow their country policy strictly while putting forward their arguments, and contribute actively in addressing the issue at hand. A delegate is expected to present them self as someone who has a grasp on the given agenda, put forwards arguments strongly and precisely, yet is open to negotiations. While a delegate should be open and friendly and welcome any talk which might help serve the purpose for which the committee was convened. At the same time, this must be ensured that only to come across as appealing to the other delegates, one must not forget their country policy and must take a firm stand even against cases which they shouldn't otherwise. </p>

                                <div class="cd-faq-content">
                                    <p>The first and foremost step in preparing for a rewarding Model UN experience is to gather information. Not only is it important to know about the country policy of the allotted delegation but it is equally important to know about the committee that has been assigned because not committees function in the same manner. </p>
